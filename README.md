# Kanter
A node based image editor for texture creation. It uses [Kanter Core](https://github.com/lukors/kanter_core) for the computation and [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) for the graphical user interface.

## Goals
- Responsiveness - It should be fast to start, and snappy to use
- Simplicity - It should be easy to understand and not be bloated with unnecessary nodes or cluttered UI
- Completeness - It should have the tools to generate every kind of texture

## Features
### Nodes
- Input: Loads an image from disk
- Output: Saves an image to disk when selected and `Shift Alt S` is pressed

### Other
- Basic node manipulation
- Instructional text in the program to guide the user

## Roadmap
The current focus is to build out basic functionality like save/load graphs, a set of basic nodes and make it nice to use. That's as far as the roadmap goes right now.

I keep all planned tasks as issues on GitHub, so check those to see what's coming up.
